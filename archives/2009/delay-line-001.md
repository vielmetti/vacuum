## Welcome

Welcome to Delay Line.  This is a new newsletter which never talks
about anything new; rather, it quotes selectively from the unremembered
past.  It is written by Edward Vielmetti with the help of a cast
of thousands, always credited to the best of my ability, but not
always remembered.

The premise of Delay Line is that we are bombarded in the Internet
with the promise that everything we are looking at is always brand
new, and that this is enough of a systematic myth that it bears
countering with tales of 'borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered
80s'.  As such it is one part historical journal, one part sets of
tales of past futures that never came to be, and a third part an
excuse to ignore tonight's instant messages and instead read ten
year old instant messages.

## Retrofuturism

The study of the futures of the past is referred to as 'retrofuturism'
by Lloyd Dunn, a 90s zine pioneer.  This discipline looks at
previous worlds and how their futures were depicted, in order
to better understand what has and has not come about in its place.

Every history has its future; my future of choice is the world
circa about 1993, back in the day when the World Wide Web was just
forming, before the BLINK tag, and when Gopher was still viable.
You could imagine any future of the net and it just might come true.

## The history of the future of news

The history of the future of news has quite a bit of fiction in it
and some very useful fact.  I'll share the facts first, since the
fiction gets repeated over and over again in new guises, and the
facts are much less often visited.

My first exposure to the future of news was in reading bits of the
Associated Press wire service, culled by the AI systems that ran
at Stanford's SAIL lab, and subsequently forwarded out to mailing
lists and the occasional Usenet newsgroup very selectively and
somewhat surreptitiously.  AP often had better stories than anything
that the netnews people were writing - better writers, more detail,
better quotes from more interesting people - and thus pulling in
their stream meant that you were better informed for some increment
of journalism.

A subsequent experience with wire service news was a short lived
commercial service we set up at MSEN that took the Reuters news
wire, pulled it off a satellite dish, decoded it, and repackaged
it as NNTP-ready Usenet news postings.  Reuters had no clue that
this was even possible, and they weren't happy when they found out,
but I have to tell you that this is the only way to read breaking news -
fresh stories off the wire as soon as each paragraph is complete.

The typical history of news goes back to the "Daily Me", Nicholas
Negroponte's fiction of a personalized newspaper that looks like
something no one else would ever see.  Lots of systems have been
pushed into this void (as portals, customized clippings, or personal
dashboards) and none of them are news wires; they all rely on some
overly dumbed down Central Services bundling out a sanitized stream
into neat little bits, surrounded by generic advertising for It's
Not Butter.  bleah.

The other futuristic vision is a Stasi-like "hyperlocal" reporting,
where every single person on every block is a snitch for a local
news outlet, and no conversation in any cafe goes unreported.  This
is fine if you live in a fishbowl, and irritating otherwise.  It's
not clear how anyone will protect themselves from an irritated
neighbor going on a network-assisted vendetta, so I guess you need
to make good friends with your neighbors in this particular hyperlocal
future.

## Distributed systems vs centralized

Call me old-fashioned, I guess, but when I think of a future of news,
I really want to be a wire service editor, with way too much copy
streaming into my own desktop and lots of flexible tools to store
it and sift through it and send back updates to be distributed
elsewhere.  We've lost in this late 2000s web 2.0 era of the net
quite a bit of the distributed systems world view that characterized
the 80s and 90s, and instead of world-wide confederations of independent
systems we have Google and Twitter and Yahoo and Facebook.  Allow
me to be irritated by that just long enough to want to fix it.

## Re-establishing old connections

A piece of my goal for this effort is to reconnect on my own terms
with people who have faded out from the nets that I watch just because
they don't read the same kinds of news that I watch, in part because
the net has exploded in size and some part of that explosion
wants me to twitch every time a movie star reaches for Twitter.

Delay Line will promise to be slow in coming, and longer in format,
if only to counteract that premise that shorter is better.  It will
not be possible to read it on a mobile phone screen, and it will
look best on a 24x80 screen.  

My best source of long lived connections is the directories and
accounts of long-dead systems.  UUCP and Usenet maps are good,
as are notes on old conference proceedings, ancient Rolodexes,
and technical notes on long-dead protocols.   Some of the people who
were my teachers in this world have retired, and a few have passed
away, and my upstart peers trying to overthrow the world of bisync
with their analog modems are getting gray.

## Terms and conditions

Unlike other things I've put together in the past, Delay Line
is not free.   You have to pay something to get it in your
hands.  I'll accept barter of many things, and won't insist
on specific amounts, but at the very least you should be prepared
to buy me a very fine lunch in order to get this.  Perhaps indeed
you'll be introduced to others who have bought that same very
fine lunch.

Negroponte wrote of "predictive models" for human behavior, which
is just about enough motivation for me to smash the machine right there.
