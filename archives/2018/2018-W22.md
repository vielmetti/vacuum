### FOIA denial for approved (?) police labor agreement

On May 21, Ann Arbor City Council passed CA-10, which reads: 
"Resolution to Approve the Collective Bargaining Agreement 
with the Command Officers Association of Michigan (COAM), 
effective January 1, 2018 - December 31, 2020". This was
approved unanimously by council, but curiously the Legistar
agenda did not include a copy of the agreement. So I asked
for a copy via FOIA.

On May 31, my FOIA 1416 for this agreement was denied on the
grounds that the agreement was not in final format and had
not been approved by all parties.

I've sent in a new FOIA for the draft agreement. After all,
City Council approved it, so they must have at least read it? But
the more denials I get the less sure I am that there was
effective City Council oversight of the contract process.
