Welcome to Vacuum!

Saul is now walking, more steady on his feet than ever.  This seems
to have distracted him somewhat from the climbing that he still
enjoys.  Along with the walking comes the newfound ability to carry
things while moving, usually a book, sometimes a book aimed squarely
at Papa's head to get him to read it.

Off to the library tomorrow to get a fresh batch of books.

Thanks to everyone who replied about sign language.  Braddlee
mentioned that the ASL course he's taking in Boston has a couple of
hearing mothers in it learning sign to teach their kids.  I've
located a video which will hopefully get me up to speed a little
bit.  A new sign this week: "book".  (And I think, though I'm not
sure, a new phrase - "more book".)

### Thinking places

Cynthia Froggatt, author of "Work Naked", a book about telecommuting
(see p.121-122 for a profile of my former telecommuting life at
Cisco) asked about what sort of places you need for thinking.
Here's what I wrote to her.

Two ideas on "thinking places" for me.

One place is full of books, computers, phones, etc. - at the moment
that's my home office where I keep my collection of 8 years of
notebooks, reference materials, and other parts of my
technologically assisted memory.  This is good for creative thinking
that's pretty demanding of having materials at my fingertips.  The
desk setup is two laptops, phone, table, filing cabinet, several
bookshelves full of books, and I sit on a big blue exercise ball.
(The Steelcase people might like a photo of the exercise ball, it's
a great chair.)

The other place is the exact opposite - lots of people around, but
not very many paper materials, and a sense of quiet in amongst the
noise.  Essential materials for this is a bound quadrille notebook,
a couple of good pens in various colors, and a coffee shop that's
moderately busy.  I have at least 6 to choose from within a mile of
here that do the trick.

The bound notebooks are the key tool for thinking, much more so than
any computing technology, because they let me escape the limits of
text and linear layout (and let me doodle when it makes sense).
And, I have a collection of them that goes back far enough in time
that I can re-create a moment from years ago by opening up a page.

[If you have any ideas on your favorite thinking places, I'd love to
hear them.]

### Neighborhood networks

I've set up an e-mail list for people who live on my street -- all 2
blocks worth of us.  A neighbor across the street keeps track of the
inventory of tools that people have said they're willing to share,
and another neighbor and I are looking into putting together some
kind of referrals list so that people new to town (e.g.  him) can
get at least a couple of names of plumbers, heating repair, etc.
that their neighbors trust.

Some of the back and forth is just an excuse to be generous to your
neighbor.  It's paid off a few times -- our street doesn't always
get plowed first or even second or third when it snows, and the last
big snowstorm saw a big crew of neighbors shoveling each other and
stray stuck cars out.

There may be technology that helps this, but that's not really
clear.  What has helped a ton has been regular walks with Saul in a
stroller so that I just happen to bump into people as they come home
in the evenings.  let's hope the winter is not so icy.

I've been thinking it might be fun to go to the local community
college or city rec and ed department and offer to teach a class on
community networks.  It sure would be fun...

thanks

Ed
