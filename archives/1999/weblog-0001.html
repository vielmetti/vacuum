<h3>Left side / right side</h3>
<p>
30% of my time I will spend thinking about the left side of the page;
and 55% the right side.  That leaves 15% for white space.
<h3>What we're looking for</h3>
<p>
Bound, acid-free, quadrille ruled notebooks.  Paul Saffo notes that he
can find things reliably in the interview notebooks he keeps; I've got
paper going back to 1993 or so in which I happily go and grab more 
detail put in ink that I could ever retain in ASCII.  
<p>
Weblog software.  It appears to be easy enough to just type in the
raw HTML, but some part of me wants to believe that bits of this process
should be automated.
<h3>What we're listening to</h3>
Deb is reading for 
<a href="http://www.assistivemedia.org">Assistive Media</a>; tonight's
live reading is on human cannibalism (brrr).  April's recordings are
up at the moment.  Assistive Media is a finalist for the 1999 Progressive
Streamers Award - the best non-profit website using RealMedia - presented by
RealNetworks.
<p>
<A href="http://www.radiohc.org">Radio Habana Cuba</A> on shortwave 
on 6000 Khz, late night EST.  I'm using a fall-of-the-Berlin Wall
vintage Sony ICF 2010 receiver to pick up broadcasts.  International
shortwave broadcasting gears up during conflicts like the one in Kosovo.
<p>
Hedningarna's 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305323283/tubed">
Karelia Visa</a> on the
<a href="http://www.noside.com">Northside</a>
label.  Super Nordic roots sounds from this label, I don't think anything
yet I've gotten from them has been a miss.

I'm typing this from O'Hare airport, in a cool service called
<a href="http://www.laptoplane.com">Laptop Lane</a>
near gate B-15.  For less than the cost of a cell phone roaming
call you get a little cubicle with a PC, an Internet connection,
and a phone with long distance service, printer and fax.  
<h3>13 May 1999</h3>
New issue of Vacuum, the newsletter is out, on
<a href="http:./vacuum-22-creative-problems.txt">creative problem solving</a>
and some musings on work.  (It's ascii, not html, so the links won't
link and it will be kind of plain looking.)
<h3>12 May 1999</h3>
Huh, this daily weblog stuff is too hard.  But I can manage
it a few times a week.  I'm on the road this week in San Jose,
so some of the links will reflect that.
<p>
David Erdody's
<a href="http://www.assistivemedia.org">Assistive Media</a>
won the 1999 Streamers award for best use of streaming media
by a non-profit.  Watch the
<a href="http://play.rbn.com/?url=rn/rnc/g2demand/streamers99.rm&proto=rtsp">
presentation</a> (the award is about 41 minutes in).
A big surprise went with the award - an anonymous donor 
presented Assistive Media with a check for $10,000 !
<p>
<a href="http://www.gocreate.com">Right Brain Works</a>
is a creativity shop - they have a mailing list that goes
out called
<a href="http://rbwlist.listbot.com">Heads Up!</a>
with links to web stuff and news that relate to the creative
impulse.
<p>
The
<a href="http://www.wunderground.com">Weather Underground</a>

They have all manner of cool references that let you link
in to the current weather.

In the changing world of work series:
The LA Times ran a story about 
<a href="http://www.latimes.com/CNS_DAYS/990510/t000041888.html">
techie burnout</a>
that is worth a read.
It quotes from Richard Sennett's book
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393046788/tubed">
The Corrosion of Character : The Personal Consequences of Work in the
New Capitalism</a>, which I haven't read (Amazon reviews are mixed,
but who trusts Amazon readers?)
<p>
Vacuum reader and 
<a href="http://www.treefort.org/~jacobs/">GeneHack</a>
weblogger John S Jacobs Anderson unearthed a tool for
maintaining weblogs called
<a href="http://www.freddyfrog.com/hacks/genpage/">genpage</a>,
which is said to help automate the process of laying out pages
and maintaining consistency.
<p>
Thanks to

<h3>7 May 1999</h3>
Several Vacuum readers are at
<a href="http://www.edgewise.com">Edgewise 99</a>
in New York City.  (At the very least,
<a href="http://www.peterme.com">Peter Merholz</a>,
<a href="http://argus-inc.com">Lou Rosenfeld</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.sociate.com">Jerry Michalski</a>.)
Peter's weblog of the event is particularly worth a look.
<p>
If you're like me, you sometimes have a hard time getting
up in the morning because you were up too late the night
before looking at the web.  And alarms don't have the same
sting when you're working at home.  I'm going to try to
schedule wakeup calls with <a href="http://www.mrwakeup.com">Mr. Wakeup</a>
and see if that rouses me a bit better.
<p>
Before you go into a big box appliance store looking to buy
your next bit of electronic apparatus, go to
<a href="http://www.mysimon.com">mySimon</a>
and generate a price comparison list.  You'll be better
informed than the floor salesman, and much better armed to
walk away with what you want at a price that's reasonable.
(And if they won't deal, you can walk away and order from the
net.)
<p>
The 4 May <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com">Robot Wisdom</a>
weblog run by Jorn Barger took notice of what's going on here
at Vacuum.  Jorn writes:
"New weblog from Ed Vielmetti, who's been on the Net forever."
(Not quite forever, but more than 100 dog-years, which means I
should be able to retire soon right?)
<p>
Jorn picked up a story from the
<a href="http://eXaminer.com">San Francisco Examiner</a>
on
<a href="http://eXaminer.com/microloans/">microloans</a>,
offering poor people around the world access to
commercial credit
to help bootstrap them out of poverty.

<h3>5 May 1999</h3>
A major
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mi.us/www/fmd/fire/special.htm">forest fire</a>
is burning in western Marquette County, Michigan
in the Upper Peninsula
near the small towns of
Republic,
Champion, and
Michigamme.
The information hotline is at 1-800-227-9668 set up by WNMU TV13
and staffed by volunteers.
The folks at
<a href="http://www.travelup.com/weather.html">Travel U.P.</a>
have been keeping an eye on the fire and have pictures of
smoke and weather reports.
The Marquette County chapter of the American Red Cross 
is providing disaster relief;
you can send contributions to them at 1500 W Washington St,
Suite #6, Marquette MI 49855.
<p>
Joyce Wycoff
runs the
<a href="http://www.thinksmart.com">Innovation Network</a>
which publishes a weekly
"Good Morning Thinkers"
newsletter collecting ideas and responses from a farflug
network of readers.  This week's issue
focuses on
<a href="http://thinksmart.com/wakeupbrainarchive/may41999.html">
questions to stimulate creativity</a>.
My favorite was from
serge@cistron.nl (Serge)
who suggests
"In how many ways can we ..."
as the classic brainstorm question.
<p>
Ron Dwelle
in
<a href="news:alt.great-lakes">alt.great-lakes</a>
recommends the
<a href="http://www.glc.org/projects/circle/mi.html">Lake Michigan
Circle Tour</a> guide as a source for travel information for scenic
highways.  The newsgroup is helping someone plan a bike trip around
the lake - Ron also notes and I would concur that the nice way across
the Straits of Mackinac is to take the ferry from St. Ignace to
Mackinac Island and go from there to Mackinaw City again by ferry.
No cars on the island (just horses, bikes, tourists and fudge).
<p>
Anyone have any good contacts at the Amazon affiliates program?
It's nice to get a quarterly statement and a check, but it should
be possible to turn that quarterly statement directly into more
book sales (generate some HTML from it that points back at you
and there you go).  
<a href="http://www.rageboy.com">Chris Locke</a>
has done this for 
<a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/egr-list/79.html">
books bought by Entropy Gradient Reversals readers</a>,
but only at the expense of a bunch of manual labor.  It
should be easy!

Roger Breisch,
rebreisch@aol.com,
runs the Midwest Organizational Learning Network
based in Chicago.
(Five hours by train from here, too far to pop over for an evening's
event, but still close enough to feel like I should know what's going
on there).
He notes a forthcoming conference on
"<a href="http://www.aqp.org/neweconomy.html">People and the New Economy</a>: 
A forum 
for resolving the paradox between economic reality & human values"
in Chicago July 28-30.  On the speaker list is

<h3>3 May 1999</h3>
The

record ever stopped anyone from going to a game?)
<p>
<a href="http://www.anaconda.net">Anaconda</a>
has tools for sale that automate the process of
building an Amazon bookstore.  It's aimed at making
the process "sticky" to give you the maximum commissions.
Thanks to 
Steven Champeon 
for the pointer, 
(though he doesn't use it himself).
<p>
Another source for Lomo cameras (inexpensive Russian snapshot
camera with nice lens) is
<a href="http://www.freestylesalesco.com/holga.html#Lomo">
Freestyle Sales Co</a>
in California.
$13-15 a piece, I have two on order.
A review on a
<a href="http://www.lomo.org/bbs/index.cgi?read=2926">LomoChat BBS</a>
says "a really cool little camera!! It is plastic
but the back fits tight and it's quite well made."
<h3>1 May 1999</h3>

General purpose computers capable of running standard
operating systems are getting better, faster, smaller,
cheaper, lighter, and less power-hungry. 
This puts them in a place to challenge
special purpose computers - so called "embedded systems" -
that have been traditionally used in low-power environments.
See the
<a href="http://wearables.stanford.edu/">world's smallest web server</a>,
matchbox sized,
as one example.  Noted by Richard Campbell via Joe McConnell.

The 
<a href="http://www.crrel.usace.army.mil/ierd/soo/">Soo Locks Web Cam</a>
is back up by popular demand.  They're working on getting better quality
cameras.
<p>
Brief review on today's
<a href="http://www.camworld.com">CamWorld</a> pegs
this effort as an Ann Arbor weblog "[Wow!]".  I guess
I get a lot of Ann Arbor stuff in my mailbox.
<p>
I talked with Scott Hapgood at 
<a href="http://www.eurekalabbook.com">Eureka Lab Book</a>, in Holyoke MA
(1-413-534-5671).  He's sending me one of their "Standard Laboratory
Notebooks" on approval, and if I like it I'll mail him a check for $23.
They do customer printing in lots of 100
or so.  Lined or quadrille, round-back binding so you can paste in sheets
without breaking the binding, choice of cover colors, acid-free archival
quality paper.  I'll report when it comes in.

Jock Gill has written a page on

Microsoft is buying <a href="http://www.jump.com">Jump</a>,

New York Times, but I dno't have a link; there's no news yet
of it on the Jump site itself.  But I do believe the Times.  Mostly.)

<a href="http://www.powells.com">Powell's Books</a> has an
enormous catalog of used and new books, they're definitely worth
a look when you are book hunting.  I found a copy of the
Lee Ash <b>Subject Collections</b> reference book there, a
directory of special libraries and special collections within
public and research libraries.  Looking forward to the shipment
arriving.  Another source recommended by Powell's for used books is 
<a href="http://www.bibliofind.com">Bibliofind</a>, which will
save a search for you and e-mail the results if a book comes in to
one of their many participating used book network stores.

Deb heard a *marvelous* piece on NPR yesterday on "This American Life" about
a kindergarten/first-grade teacher who instituted the rule "You can't say
you can't play", to keep her kids from excluding each other from
playing.  She says "I was so moved, that I went and listened to it again."
It's at <a href="http://www.thislife.org/pages/archive96.html#27">
www.thislife.org</a> 47:00 into the selection.
The teacher is Vivian Paley, and she wrote a book also titled

<h3>25 April 1999</h3>
<h4>Log off now</h4>
<a href="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?back=archive99/now0423.txt">
Need To Know</a>, a UK weblog, reports on a Europe-wide telecommunications
boycott for 1999-06-06 aimed at getting rates down and eliminating
per-minute charges on local calls.  This is echoed in an unattributed
<a href="http:./vacuum-20-net-strike.txt">Net Strike 2000-2003</a>
calling for a general boycott of the Internet for three years:
"The refusal to labour is the chief weapon of workers fighting the system; 
networkers can use the same weapon."
<h4>Weblogs</h4>
I've given a look at about a dozen other weblog sites.  The one I
look at the most regularly (aside from this site, naturally) is
Peter Merholz's <a href="http://www.peterme.com">peterme</a>;
Peter recommends Cameron Barrett's 
<a href="http://www.camworld.com">CamWorld</a> as a fine example of
the genre and a comprehensive source of pointers to other sites.
This Vacuum version is somewhat uglier than the norm, but that's
a tradition.
<h4>Books</h4>
Sunday New York Times, $4 at the 
<a href="http://www.geol.ucsb.edu/~trecker/images/UM/BlueF1.jpg">Blue Front
</a> (pix credit Molly Trecker).  In the book reviews:
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/25/reviews/990425.25wrightt.html">
The Meme Machine</a> by Susan Blackmore.  It's been 23 years since Richard
Dawkins "Selfish Gene", and the meme meme has gone pretty far in propogating
itself.  The Times has a copy of the first chapter of Blackmore's
book online; looks pretty promising.  Here's what they say at
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198503652/tubed">Amazon</a>.
(later)  I picked up a copy at
<a href="http://www.shamandrum.com">Shaman Drum</a> in the Science /
Environment section;
a pretty good read.  I guess I've been taken in by the weblog meme.
<h4>Bookshelves</h4>
Home office reorg, with Deb's help!  
Moved all the furniture counterclockwise, put up new
bookshelves, set the filing cabinet next to my desk so there's a spot for
the telephone and for books and papers.  Much better.  Rachel Selk from
<a href="mailto:selk@umich.edu">Twenty-fifth hour</a> has been helping me
out with the process of breaking through the piles of junk and paper that
have somehow accumulated around me, very helpful.

<h4>Notes afterwards</h4>
<p>
Are tables hideous and ugly and should they just be avoided?
I am used to marginalia in my work, it's kind of nice to
have it here.  Need to get precision measurements for layout
so that it starts to be more exactly what's on paper.
<p>
This looks pretty good when it just fits the page.  Nice
to know at least that the old notebook is about a screenful
if you format it right.
