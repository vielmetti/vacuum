Almost every day, I write a few words for my main weblog, "Vacuum".
It may just be notes about links to a couple of interesting pages
I've seen the day before, or it might be a few paragraphs about
something that someone asked at lunch, or it might be a notice of
an upcoming event which I'd like to let people know about. It's a
daily habit, one that by this point doesn't take any extra time in
the day beyond what I normally do.

I've been writing for the Internet since 1985, when I was an
undergraduate at the University of Michigan. The funny thing was
that writing was always very difficult for me in college, at least
the kind of collegiate writing where you were expected to produce
a 20 page paper all neatly threaded together about the details of
one assignment. When you're used to the three or four paragraph
short essay form, it takes a certain reworking of style to reach
any sort of length, and that eluded me for a long time.

My main blog, Vacuum, has been going since 1999. As such it's a
record of observations over time that's broader than my own poor
memory can recall without assistance, and I use it as such to
remember things that I've forgotten and to help put times and dates
in context. It's not a politics blog, or a super popular gizmo blog
with lots of shiny advertisements, or a center of an international
movement. It is, however, regularly and relentlessly a chronicle
of observations about Ann Arbor, and as such it helps connect me
to the place I live and work.

Ann Arbor has a long history of locally focused online commentary.
One of the first online conferencing systems, Bob Parnes CONFER,
was running on the University of Michigan mainframe in the 1970s.
Its counterpart and close analog Picospan was developed in Ann Arbor
and went on to be the tool used for The Well, a much written about
virtual community of the 1980s.

Picospan lives in in local systems like Grex, in continuous operation
for 20 years. There are people here who have been communicating
with their neighbors by typing at them for long enough that it's
second nature, and that makes writing a local blog about where to
go juneberry picking (in front of the library) sound less like
something exotic and more like part of what every functioning town
needs.

Blogging is not for everyone. It's time consuming to make sense of
some little part of the world every day in a form that you're willing
to share with the world, and it's puzzling to figure out of the
picture of the cute cat is going to send the wrong message to someone
who is viewing your blog to check out your professional biography.
Time, lurching forward into the future, has given us social network
sites like Facebook and Myspace that aren't blogs and which make
me feel old.

My great-great aunt was a gossip columnist for the Belleville, MI
newspaper, back in the days when the newspaper would print the
comings and goings of people on vacations and other things which
seem quaint and old fashioned today. Writing about the small things
that happen over a course of a few square miles makes it all that
much more tangible, and in the next few days I'll be sharing more
about some of the systems that help do that.
