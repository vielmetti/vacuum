title: Welcome to a new version of an old newsletter, "Vacuum"

After starting and stopping several newsletters and mailing lists and
weblogs over the past few decades, I'm at it again.  There are just too
many things to be said that require a format longer and more thoughtful
than random tweets, but not as impersonal as a blog. To that end, I'm
rebooting a mailing list that I first had in 1999 called "Vacuum".

The idea is to reconstruct a little community of thoughtful people
on the Internet, especially a group that has some experience with
how the net has changed, and bounce some ideas in the form of essays
off of you all. I very much hope that your thoughtful ideas will
bounce back at the group, and I plan to have a method and mechanism
for making that happen too.

"Vacuum" in its original 1999-era format started as what was then
called an "essaynet", with pieces about this size shared via a moderated
email list, and an accompanying weblog to capture and share some
of the things too short to warrant filling up people's inboxes.
That work morphed into blogging as the primary structure for
communciations, and then actually turned into a paying jobby-job
writing for AnnArbor.com.

Getting paid to write was a high point and a low point, for I had
to not only crank out 500 words a day with the phrase "Ann Arbor"
in the lead paragraph, but also read all of the comments from
a completely unmoderated, uncontrolled, wretched hive of commenters.
(Never read the comments.) When I was restructured out of a job there,
it was both a setback and a relief.

I'm back in technology now, working on open source software running
on bare metal hardware. The publishing tools of 1999 have changed
a lot, and no one is typing in HTML by hand if they can possibly
avoid it. Open source software has gotten so much better and so
much easier to distribute that there's a world of tools out there
that when properly discovered and used that give you what by
1999 standards are superpowers.

I'm hoping to write regularly for a small audience, sharing some
highlights of projects that are doing good work, keeping my eyes
and ears open for transformative technology, and looking especially
for people who have superpowers for software that makes hardware sing.
But I'm also interested in building or rebuilding community beyond
the technology and to work with people, not just technological
abstractions.

I'll be testing out the idea that writing regularly for a small engaged
audience is its own superpower, and I hope to learn as much from you
all as I share a journey to understand.
