I must have been in the cycle early for McDonald's fast-food intelligent
man-machine systems, according to Guthery's law:

McDonald's fast food computers (i.e., cash registers) collect all sorts of
data on the individual employee at the counter and on all counter sales as a
whole.  They also do not have a <no sale> key that opens up the cash
register, probably to prevent theft.  That made it real hard to fix a
mistake without calling a manager to get a key to open the drawer.

Solution?  Well, the people I worked with at McD's had been around the
system long enough to figure out how to get around it.  Without getting into
too many details of why things were as they were, the easiest way to open
the drawer without a manager was to ring up a sale that gave away a tub of
barbecue sauce for McNuggets and nothing else.  

   (Hit <promo> <barbecue> <promo> <total> .)

Of course, that messed up the daily statistics some.
