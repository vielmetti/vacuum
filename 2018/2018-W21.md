* Devops Days Detroit call for proposals

### Ann Arbor City Council passes a budget

Monday night was City Council night, and the big topic of discussion
was the budget. After a long night's worth of amendments the city
budget was approved on a 9-2 vote. 

Two controversial items of note came up. One was a budget amendment
to spend more money on road maintenance, funded by using an existing
fund balance. The second was the approval of a settlement agreement
with Dennis Dahlmann which resolved the issue of the Old Y Lot for
now, with the city paying an extra $1 million to Dahlmann as a settlement
fee to end the lawsuit over the property.

No Council events on this the fifth week of May, so we get a break
from agendas.

### Strawberry season is coming

Whittaker's Berry Farm in Ida sent notice of their annual strawberry 
picking season. They are estimating that their season will start
between June 10th and June 15th and will last about 18 days.

We have made a habit of going to Rawsonville to pick at Rowe's Produce Farm
on Father's Day.

Make sure as you make plans to go picking to wear hats, put on sunscreen,
and take plenty of water with you.
