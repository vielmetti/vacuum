### Ann Arbor City Council passes a budget

Monday night was City Council night, and the big topic of discussion
was the budget. After a long night's worth of amendments the city
budget was approved on a 9-2 vote. 

Two controversial items of note came up. One was a budget amendment
to spend more money on road maintenance, funded by using an existing
fund balance. The second was the approval of a settlement agreement
with Dennis Dahlmann which resolved the issue of the Old Y Lot for
now, with the city paying an extra $1 million to Dahlmann as a settlement
fee to end the lawsuit over the property.

No Council events on this the fifth week of May, so we get a break
from agendas.

### Respecting public comment time

Ann Arbor City Council has public comment at the beginning
and the end of each meeting, and there is time after public
comment at the end for members of council to get in their
final word or response to anything said during public comment
should they choose.

At the last council meeting a citizen came up and commented on
an agenda item after it had been approved, and a member of council
interrupted them during their three minute presentation to 
correct them on a minor point. This was uncalled for and out of order. There
was time after the end of the public commentary to make any
necessary corrections.

(This is the same member of council who wrote me once in a response
to a question saying "I donâ€™t generally comment on items on the
agenda that will be voted on during a council meeting.")

I'd like to see a little more respect for the public, especially
those few of us who have been paying attention until late at
night and have something to note that might have been missed.

### Strawberry season is coming

Whittaker's Berry Farm in Ida sent notice of their annual strawberry 
picking season. They are estimating that their season will start
between June 10th and June 15th and will last about 18 days.

We have made a habit of going to Rawsonville to pick at Rowe's Produce Farm
on Father's Day.

Make sure as you make plans to go picking to wear hats, put on sunscreen,
and take plenty of water with you.

### Recipe: Sesame noodles

These are super easy on a hot day.

The noodles are your favorite kind of noodles from the supermarket
or the Asian grocery.

The sauce is a mix of tahini, apple cider vinegar, and soy sauce,
with a few chopped green onions if you have them.

To this week's recipe I added some chopped spinach and some chopped
tomatoes. The spinach will wilt a little bit in the hot noodles.

Boil and drain the noodles, stir in the sauce when the noodles are
still hot, top with vegetables of your choice. Served this week with
asparagus and plenty of iced tea.
