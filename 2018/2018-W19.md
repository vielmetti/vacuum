### DTE Energy plans to develop old Michcon site on the Huron River

> DETROIT, May 7, 2018 â€“ DTE Energy (NYSE: DTE) today announced it
has entered into an agreement with The Roxbury Group, a Detroit-based
real estate development company, to develop an 11-acre mixed use
and public space project on the former Michigan Consolidated Gas
Company industrial site bordering the Huron River in Ann Arbor,
Mich. Located at Broadway Street at the Huron River, the project
could bring up to $75 million or more of attractive, community-benefitting
investment to this currently vacant site.

The site once had a coal gasification plant on it - as
heavy a heavy industry as you will find - and there have
been some efforts to date to remediate toxic soils on the
site.

### Liquor License Committee: poke bowls at Foundry Lofts

A poke bowl restaurant under the name of "Wild Poke" has
requested a liquor license approval from the City of Ann Arbor.
The meeting for the Liquor License Committee was on Friday,
and I don't yet know the outcome, but City Council should
take up the issue on May 21, 2018.

The fast casual restaurant would be at 413 E Huron St, in the
first floor retail space of the Foundry Lofts. The permit requests
a license to serve beer, wine, and spirits. The applicant is
Li An Yu from Maumee, OH, who currently runs the Tea Tree Asian
Bistro in Perryburg, OH.
