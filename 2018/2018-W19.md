### DTE Energy plans to develop old Michcon site on the Huron River

> DETROIT, May 7, 2018 â€“ DTE Energy (NYSE: DTE) today announced it
has entered into an agreement with The Roxbury Group, a Detroit-based
real estate development company, to develop an 11-acre mixed use
and public space project on the former Michigan Consolidated Gas
Company industrial site bordering the Huron River in Ann Arbor,
Mich. Located at Broadway Street at the Huron River, the project
could bring up to $75 million or more of attractive, community-benefitting
investment to this currently vacant site.

The site once had a coal gasification plant on it - as
heavy a heavy industry as you will find - and there have
been some efforts to date to remediate toxic soils on the
site.

### Liquor License Committee: poke bowls at Foundry Lofts

A poke bowl restaurant under the name of "Wild Poke" has
requested a liquor license approval from the City of Ann Arbor.
The meeting for the Liquor License Committee was on Friday,
and I don't yet know the outcome, but City Council should
take up the issue on May 21, 2018.

The fast casual restaurant would be at 413 E Huron St, in the
first floor retail space of the Foundry Lofts. The permit requests
a license to serve beer, wine, and spirits. The applicant is
Li An Yu from Maumee, OH, who currently runs the Tea Tree Asian
Bistro in Perryburg, OH.

### Liquor License Committee: brewing on Jorn Court

Mothfire Brewing has requested a license to operate a
microbrewery at 1443 Jorn Court, the old Dog-O-Mat space.
Noah Kaplan is the sole person named on the application;
he also runs Leon Speakers. Again this came up at the 
Liquor License committee, and I haven't heard yet if there
were any snags in the application process.

### Ypsilanti's Dalat to move to Ann Arbor

Second Wave Media reports that Ypsilanti's Dalat restaurant
is looking to relocate to Ann Arbor, with a next generation
of ownership. Son Le is the son of previous owners Lang Bui and Hoanh Le, and
he and his wife Tran Nguyen are looking to reopen in Woodland Plaza
on South Main Street (near Busch's).

### YPSI performance space

> The Ypsilanti Performance Space is coming in 2019. The YPSI will be a 250-seat concert and event venue with amazing sound in a beautiful historic building. Along with the concert hall, which will also host weddings and other special events, there will be three reception halls and meeting rooms for conferences, community meetings, special events, banquets, and more. The YPSI is located in downtown Ypsilanti and walking distance from both Depot Town and Downtown.

### Roll for initiative

If you ever need a set of dice at your fingertips for role-playing
or decision-making, the command-line program `roll` written by Matteo Corti is useful.

> This command-line based program rolls a user-defined dice sequence
and displays the result. The dices to roll are defined using dN
where N is the number of sides. Dices can be rolled multiple times
by prepending the number of repetitions (e.g., 3d6) and used in
simple mathematical expressions (e.g., 2d8+4).

I was able to install it on my Mac with `brew install roll`.
