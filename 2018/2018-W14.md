### Ann Arbor: Y Lot lawsuit, amended complaint

In the case Dahlmann and Fifth Fourth vs City of Ann Arbor,
the plaintiffs allege that the City advertised and represented
that the underground Fifth Avenue parking structure contained
a "stub" that would connect it to future underground parking
at the old Y Lot. Since this stub or interconnection was never
built, and based on other procedural irregularities in the
contract process, Dalhmann alleges that

> 67. As a result of the foregoing failure of the City and Mr. Dahlmann
to agree to, and to properly approve, the same terms for the
transaction, no valid contract was ever formed.

The City has made a Motion to Dismiss in this case; I don't
have a copy of that document yet.

### Ann Arbor: Y Lot vote at City Council

At Monday's City Council meeting, council decided to postpone the
decision on whether to exercise an option to buy back the Y Lot
from the owner Dennis Dahlmann and Fifth Fourth LLC. Council
deliberation originally put the question to a vote, but the
Council Party did not have the necessary 8 votes to approve the
buyback with CM Jane Lumm out of town and not voting.

In response to the vote, there was acrimony on council, with
especially strong language from CM Julie Grand aimed at CM Jack Eaton
for his vote. Grand characterized Eaton's "no" vote as "outrageous
and irresponsible actions" and in "direct conflict with their fiduciary
duty" in statements at Council and posted to Facebook.

Civic discourse is going on in Facebook. I suppose it has to happen somewhere.

I've sent in a FOIA for all appraisals of the Old Y Lot since 2003
to the City of Ann Arbor.

### Ann Arbor: Bead Gallery closing

The Bead Gallery on East Liberty Street in Ann Arbor is closing its
retail location after 32 years. In a notice to customers posted on

### Ann Arbor: Packard Rd / Burns Park medical marijuana nixed

In a unanimous vote, the Ann Arbor City Planning Commission decided
to turn down a special exemption use permit for a property at 1202
Packard that was proposed for use as a medical marijuana establishment.
The report after the meeting from North Burns Park Association
co-chair Peter Nagourney noted a number of objections to the
development, including lack of support from adjacent retail and
religious use, the proximity of the proposed site to existing
school and after-school programs, and traffic concerns.

### Ypsilanti: China trip scandal claims job of economic developer

Metro Times reporter Tom Perkins writes that Ypsilanti economic
development director Beth Ernat's contract will not be renewed,
after a trip that Ernat and city officials took to China related
to a proposed $300 million mixed-use development known as International
Village. The Metro Times investigation of the trip focused on who
paid for the China junket, after it was determined that Wayne State's
Chinese Students and Scholars Association was not the source of the
funds as originally stated.

> City council still does not know who paid for the officials'
travel, though it's possible that the independent attorney's report
will reveal the source.

### Rumor of MLive layoffs (Mark Maynard)

Mark Maynard's eponymous blog shares a rumor of further MLive
cuts to reporting staff, though as of this writing none of those
cuts have yet materialized. His account goes through 11 years
worth of shrinkage at the Ann Arbor News and AnnArbor.com, a
dreary litany that makes it seem like further cuts are inevitable.
