### Ann Arbor: Y Lot lawsuit, amended complaint

In the case Dahlmann and Fifth Fourth vs City of Ann Arbor,
the plaintiffs allege that the City advertised and represented
that the underground Fifth Avenue parking structure contained
a "stub" that would connect it to future underground parking
at the old Y Lot. Since this stub or interconnection was never
built, and based on other procedural irregularities in the
contract process, Dalhmann alleges that

> 67. As a result of the foregoing failure of the City and Mr. Dahlmann
to agree to, and to properly approve, the same terms for the
transaction, no valid contract was ever formed.

The City has made a Motion to Dismiss in this case; I don't
have a copy of that document yet.

### Ann Arbor: Y Lot vote at City Council

At Monday's City Council meeting, council decided to postpone the
decision on whether to exercise an option to buy back the Y Lot
from the owner Dennis Dahlmann and Fifth Fourth LLC. Council
deliberation originally put the question to a vote, but the
Council Party did not have the necessary 8 votes to approve the
buyback with CM Jane Lumm out of town and not voting.

In response to the vote, there was acrimony on council, with
especially strong language from CM Julie Grand aimed at CM Jack Eaton
for his vote. Grand characterized Eaton's "no" vote as "outrageous
and irresponsible actions" and in "direct conflict with their fiduciary
duty" in statements at Council and posted to Facebook.

Civic discourse is going on in Facebook. I suppose it has to happen somewhere.

I've sent in a FOIA for all appraisals of the Old Y Lot since 2003
to the City of Ann Arbor.
