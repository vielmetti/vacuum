### Ann Arbor: Y Lot lawsuit, amended complaint

In the case Dahlmann and Fifth Fourth vs City of Ann Arbor,
the plaintiffs allege that the City advertised and represented
that the underground Fifth Avenue parking structure contained
a "stub" that would connect it to future underground parking
at the old Y Lot. Since this stub or interconnection was never
built, and based on other procedural irregularities in the
contract process, Dalhmann alleges that

> 67. As a result of the foregoing failure of the City and Mr. Dahlmann
to agree to, and to properly approve, the same terms for the
transaction, no valid contract was ever formed.

The City has made a Motion to Dismiss in this case; I don't
have a copy of that document yet.

### Ann Arbor: Y Lot vote at City Council

At Monday's City Council meeting, council decided to postpone the
decision on whether to exercise an option to buy back the Y Lot
from the owner Dennis Dahlmann and Fifth Fourth LLC. Council
deliberation originally put the question to a vote, but the
Council Party did not have the necessary 8 votes to approve the
buyback with CM Jane Lumm out of town and not voting.

In response to the vote, there was acrimony on council, with
especially strong language from CM Julie Grand aimed at CM Jack Eaton
for his vote. Grand characterized Eaton's "no" vote as "outrageous
and irresponsible actions" and in "direct conflict with their fiduciary
duty" in statements at Council and posted to Facebook.

Civic discourse is happening on Facebook. I suppose it has to happen somewhere.

I've sent in a FOIA for all appraisals of the Old Y Lot since 2003
to the City of Ann Arbor.

### Ann Arbor: Aunt Agatha's Mystery Bookshop closing

Aunt Agatha's Mystery Bookshop on South Fourth Ave in Ann Arbor
is closing after 26 years, according to an April 2, 2018 letter to customers
on Facebook. Owners Robin and Jamie Agnew write: 

> We have enjoyed getting to know many of you, discussing books with
you, sharing author events with you and sharing the love of mysteries
with you for 26 years. Many of you we are happy to think of as
friends. It's been a wonderful journey.

### Ann Arbor: Bead Gallery closing

The Bead Gallery on East Liberty Street in Ann Arbor is closing its
retail location after 32 years. In a notice to customers posted on
their web site, the owners write:

> After 32 years in business The Bead Gallery and Adorn Me will be
closing its doors. We have loved being a part of the downtown Ann
Arbor community, loved getting to know our customers, and providing
a creative place of inspiration, joy, and friendship. We want to
thank all of you for your continued support over the last three
decades, as we have grown and changed. 

The owners plan to open up shop online on Etsy.

### Ann Arbor: Packard Rd / Burns Park medical marijuana nixed

In a unanimous vote, the Ann Arbor City Planning Commission decided
to turn down a special exemption use permit for a property at 1202
Packard that was proposed for use as a medical marijuana establishment.
The report after the meeting from North Burns Park Association
co-chair Peter Nagourney noted a number of objections to the
development, including lack of support from adjacent retail and
religious use, the proximity of the proposed site to existing
school and after-school programs, and traffic concerns.

### Ypsilanti: China trip scandal claims job of economic developer

Metro Times reporter Tom Perkins writes that Ypsilanti economic
development director Beth Ernat's contract will not be renewed,
after a trip that Ernat and city officials took to China related
to a proposed $300 million mixed-use development known as International
Village. The Metro Times investigation of the trip focused on who
paid for the China junket, after it was determined that Wayne State's
Chinese Students and Scholars Association was not the source of the
funds as originally stated.

> City council still does not know who paid for the officials'
travel, though it's possible that the independent attorney's report
will reveal the source.

### Rumor of MLive layoffs (Mark Maynard)

Mark Maynard's eponymous blog shares a rumor of further MLive
cuts to reporting staff, though as of this writing none of those
cuts have materialized. His account goes through 11 years
worth of shrinkage at the Ann Arbor News and AnnArbor.com, a
dreary litany that makes it seem like further cuts are inevitable.

### "Jobs are plentiful" - Bridge Magazine

Bridge Magazine's Mike Wilkinson writes about Michigan's jobs
comeback, quoting yours truly with the best barometer I know
of job activity - the number of attendees at my weekly a2b3 lunch
series.

> But they’re certainly better than they were and Ed Vielmetti has a good barometer of how much better: At the height of the downturn, he led weekly lunch meetings in Ann Arbor where workers in software engineering and web publishing would kibitz and trade job tips.

> As many as 35 people would show up. They had the time because they weren’t just working.

> Today the meetings attract about six or seven folks, said Vielmetti, who works from home for a New York-based tech company.

> “If people are less free these days because they’re working,” Vielmetti said. “That’s a good thing.”

### Sports: Quiet night after basketball loss

Michigan lost the NCAA Basketball national championship to Villanova,
79-62, in an event that saw Ann Arbor streets relatively quiet after
a loss. A big police presence on South University looked for forestall
a repeat of the 1989 basketball riots, but by all reports things were
relatively quiet on Monday night with the loss. I saw a few fireworks
lit off near Hill and State.

One way to keep track of what's going on during an event is to listen
to the police scanner, but seasoned journalists will always tell you to
"never tweet the scanner" - it's unconfirmed and as likely to be wrong
as right.

### In other newsletters: Chris Salzman on ownership of the web

Chris is doing a newsletter, in part because he's frustrated by
The Great Algorithm deciding what he's going to see.

> I’m all for the barrier to creation being lowered. I’m not for
the control of the display of that creation to be ceded to a few
large publicly traded companies. Again, I want more people to have
ways to create and catalog the things they care about in their own
space. Owning your own little corner of the internet allows you to
do different things with it than trusting The Great Algorithm to
sort it out for you.

### In other newsletters: George Hotelling on Unix command line tools

George Hotelling's "90% Crud" roundup for April 6 includes a nice
little section on super-handy Unix tools for manipulating JSON
files from the command line. He calls out "jq", "gron", and "pup"
for further study if you are dealing with JSON from the command
line in cases where good old-fashioned "sed" and "awk" don't quite
have the right toolset to take care of the parsing by themselves.

Julia Evans (@b0rk) has a wonderful set of zines and
cartoons that she uses to illustrate fundamental Unix
system, Internet, and debugging principles.

### Calendar: Ann Arbor Library Camp April 13, 2018

This unconference is held at the Ann Arbor District Library
downtown branch. Show up during the morning sessions to help
plan a day of discussions for library and "library-adjacent" people.
Open to the public.

> Library Camp doesn't mean burned marshmallows, mosquito bites,
or popsicle stick-based art projects. It's an informal unconference
gathering to share ideas, technologies, and wonderings.

### Calendar: Ann Arbor City Council Working Session, April 9, 2018

A late addition: the Ann Arbor City Council will go into 
special session to discuss "pending litigation" after their
April 9, 2018 working session. It is anticipated that the
topic of discussion will be the Old Y Lot litigation, and
there's some chance that when they come out of closed session
that there will be an open session to address the postponed
matters from the April 2, 2018 meeting.

Beware of special sessions with no agenda published in advance!
