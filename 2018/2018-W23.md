### Community High School graduation

My older son graduated from Community High School. I am rather proud
of him. The CHS mascot is the "rainbow zebra", and as such it was
not all that surprising to see the seniors lined up in all kinds of
outfits - some with mortarboards, most without, and all manner of style
on display.

### First U-Pick strawberries arrive; peas still a week away

Weather permitting, you can pick strawberries at local U-Pick farms
this week. The first of the local berry crop is in. We generally also
wait until the English shelling pea crop is in before going out.

Local U-Pick farms and their crops are listed on Arborwiki
on the [U-Pick](https://localwiki.org/ann-arbor/U-Pick) page.
Note that details change from year to year and you want to call
ahead or check the farm's web site or other page for details.

Strawberries are picking now, and asparagus season has just ended. (917) 837-0975 4700 Whitmore Lake Rd, Ann Arbor MI.

### Nearing the end of asparagus season

At Farmers Market this week I got what is probably the last of the local
asparagus crop. My favorite way to prepare asparagus is very simple. Bring
some water to boil in a large shallow pan. Wash and snap the asparagus,
being sure to rinse off any grit. Put the asparagus into the boiling water
and blanch for 3 minutes. The cooking water will be green perhaps with a
yellow tinge. Remove from the heat and drain. The asparagus will be
tender-crisp and green and not limp. Serve as-is or stir-fry briefly 
with nuts and garlic.

### Summer Game starts June 15 at Ann Arbor District Library

The Ann Arbor Summer Game starts June 15 at the Ann Arbor District Library.
Play to win points that you can trade in for fantastic prizes.

I don't quite know what to expect for this year's game as the library
has a new catalog - but I am sure it will be fun.

### Design Review Board

The Ann Arbor Design Review Board meets irregularly to review downtown
developments. Most recently, it met to influence the DDA's plans for
their makeover of the Ann-Ashley garage, and their critique led to the
abandonment of plans to install a "cheese grater" style external aluminum
facade on the structure.

This week is a special meeting on Wednesday June 13 at 3:00 p.m. Legistar
does not disclose much in the way of details of what they are planning
to discuss this week, beyond a single line item of "Review of Design Guidelines".
If you have strong feelings about downtown architecture, this is a good
group to keep tabs on.

### Community Policing Task Force

The Advisory Task Force Regarding The Community Policing Commission
has not yet published an agenda for their Tuesday, June 12 meeting.
Communications from the chair suggest that it will be a "listening session",
but it's not clear what other business will be transacted. A Monday, June 11
meeting at Arrowwood is a private meeting also characterized as a 
"listening session" which several members of the Advisory Task Force
are invited to attend.

### OK Goober

Things I learned: my phone responds to "OK Goober" in the very same way that it responds to "OK Google".

### Recipe: Green beans with lemons

It's not local green bean season yet, but this bright
approach should work for other vegetables too.

Ingredients: green beans, garlic, olive oil, lemon, salt, pepper.

Slice the lemon into thin rounds, discarding the seeds.
You'll want an organic lemon since you'll be using the rind.

Boil water in a big pot. Wash and trim the green beans. 
Blanch the green beans in the hot water for 3 minutes,
until the beans are crisp-tender and the water is pale
green. Drain.

In the same pot heat some olive oil. Slice the garlic thin
and saute it until it just starts to turn color (2 minutes).
Add the green beans back into the pot, season with salt
and pepper, and stir fry briefly (3 minutes). Turn the 
heat up and add the lemon slices. Cook just until the
lemon slices are browned (2 minutes). Remove from heat.
The dish can be served hot or at room temperature.

I didn't do this, but next time I'd take some white wine
and deglaze the pan.
