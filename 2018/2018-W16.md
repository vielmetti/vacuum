### Ann Arbor: Archie the dog is found

Archie, an 11 year old Basenji, left home on the run on Wednesday, April 18. 
His owner, K'nal (@knamballa) posted a plea for help to Twitter with
a photo, to the attention of several popular dog-Twitter accounts. The
message ping-ponged through the network after a timely retweet by @darth.

The message was relayed by Lizz Trudeau (@lizzjoy)
to a neighborhood group on NextDoor. From there it
was reposted to other neighborhoods as Archie was spotted heading west,
first crossing from the north side of the Huron River at Argo Dam,
and from there to Hockey Lane in Water Hill.

The happy news is that Archie was found and reunited with his
owner, with a sore tooth and some minor scrapes for his troubles
in a journey that took him three miles from home.

The tweet for Archie got over 70,000 views and 200+ retweets from
people all over the globe, and Nextdoor got the message to the eyes
on the street near where Archie was spotted. It turns out the
challenge to dog-searching on Nextdoor is that you need to have
friends in other neighborhoods, because you can't post a message
directly to a neighborhood too far away. And since Nextdoor is
members-only and not public, the post I want to share here is
rejected with "The content you're looking for was posted in another
neighborhood."

### Ann Arbor City Council: Y Lot vote on Monday, April 24 in special session

The Ann Arbor City Council will again take up the issue of
exercising its option to repurchase the Old Y Lot (350 S Fifth)
from owner Dennis Dahlmann. Council had considered this issue
in its regular session of Monday, April 17, but postponed the
vote an extra week in the interest in reaching a settlement of
the lawsuit Dahlmann v City of Ann Arbor.

Documents released to the Ann Arbor Area Government Documents Repository,
aka a2docs, include the City's motion to dismiss in the lawsuit,
as well as the latest appraisal of the property by the city.
The appraisal had originally been withheld by the city, but
a FOIA appeal by Ryan Stanton of the Ann Arbor News to city administrator
Howard Lazardus resulted in the document being released.

Always appeal your FOIAs!

### Ann Arbor Community High School lockdown

On Friday, April 20 at about 10:30 a.m., students at Community High School went into
lockdown after two unknown individuals entered the school. The
all-clear was given after the Ann Arbor Police Department
was called to investigate.

> The rumor that the two individuals were armed is false as has been confirmed by AAPD lead investigator.

Superintendent Jeanice Swift and Community High School Dean Marci 
Tuzinsky sent out notices to parents once the situation was clear.

A report from the scene was that the school PA system was
not working at the time, causing a lot of confusion in a time
of possible crisis. I've sent a FOIA into the district to find out
more.

### Ann Arbor real estate: "The George" reciever's report

The property formerly known as as "Packard Square", now "The George",
went into receivership after developer Craig Schubiner failed
to make adequate progress and lost the backing of his lenders. Ann Arbor's
McKinley was appointed receiver by Judge Archie Brown of Washtnenaw Circuit Court.

The court requires that McKinley make periodic reports on progress,
and the February 2018 report is available. It notes events and milestones,
and has photos and receipts of work done. Of particular note is Exhibit
D, "List of Issues and Defects Encountered to Date", which itemizes 65
separate problems with the site that McKinley and its contractors 
have addressed or are in the process of addressing. The issues include
poorly fitting door strikes (#65), a misconfigured elevator (#60), crushed
plumbing (#37), a hastily constructed roof (#36), building materials
delivered out of order (#9), and a lack of waterproofing throughout
the property (#2).

### Michigan basketball: accident report from NTSB for March 2017 crash

The Detroit News first reported on the National Transportation
Safety Board's preliminary findings in the crash following an aborted
takeoff of a charter airplane with 116 souls on board, carring the
University of Michigan men's basketball team on a March 8, 2017
trip to Washington, DC for the Big Ten tournament.

The News read through the 881 pages in the report and highlighted
the good judgement of 54 year-old pilot Mark Radloff, who decided
in a split second to abort the takeoff, even though the plane was
above the maximum speed for that decision. Though he violated
well-established aviation protocol in this incident, Radloff's
decision may well have saved many lives. The accident led to one
injury and no fatalities as the plane slid off the end of the runway.

> Both pilots indicated that the initial takeoff roll on runway 23L
was normal until the Captain in the left seat attempted to rotate
the airplane. According to the Captainâ€™s interview, the airplane
would not rotate once they reached their rotation speed, and he
elected to reject the takeoff.  About 1452 EST (1952Z), the airplane
exited the end of runway 23L and came to rest in a field just beyond
the departure end of runway 23L. The crew subsequently conducted
an evacuation of the airplane.  There was no post-crash fire, and
the airplane sustained substantial damage.

### Marquette: Word on the Street newsletter

In other civic newsletters:

Word on the Street is a regular newsletter by former CNN journalist
Brian Cabell who writes about the goings on in Marquette, Michigan
in the Upper Peninsula. The coverage is informal, a bit gossipy,
and crucially it fills a news hole left by the continuing shrinkage
of the long-time daily newspaper (The Mining Journal).

In recent issues, Brian writes about proposed condos on the
lakeshore, the future of the old Marquette General Hospital,
and plans for a new bar in South Marquette. 
The publication has a smattering of advertising including Vango's Pizza,
a real estate brokerage, and information about cremation from a funeral home. 

A Marquette resident who I saw at Farmer's Market today visiting their sister
who lives in Water Hill talked to me about it at market, comparing
it with this newsletter and suggesting that if I wanteed a bigger
audience for this modest publication that I should "dumb it down" a bit.

### Amherstburg, Ontario: Earthquake, did you feel it?

A 3.6 magnitude earthquake hit Amherstburg, Ontario, about 35 miles from Ann Arbor,
on Thursday, April 19, 2018 at 8:01 p.m. The quake was felt by some from
Sarnia to Pinckney to Cleveland, and was widely reported on
the Detroit evening news.

Did you feel it? I didn't, but a friend in Windsor, Ontario did,
and she reported that her computer monitors were "dancing all over my desk" and
that the quake "shook the house hard for a good 10 seconds".
Newspaper reports from the epicenter described a "loud boom and
a rumble".

### Books: Get Momentum, Jason and Jodi Womack

Author Jason Womack of Ojai, California visited Ann Arbor in October 2016
and hosted a get-together at Zingerman's Next Door for readers of
his books on productivity and management. In "Get Momentum", he writes with
co-author Jodi Womack about how to get unstuck when you're stuck.

A favorite suggestion is to spend 30 minutes looking 30 days out
in your calendar, to make sure that you don't get surprised by
something on the near event horizon. Jason writes about missing
his father's birthday one year because it snuck up on him, and when
I did this exercise today I realized that I was a month early
to celebrate my sister's birth month. (We don't get too particular
about dates in the family, but it's good to get the greetings into
the correct month).

### Recipe: Garlic Mustard

Each year on Earth Day, I pull the garlic mustard from my back yard.
This remembers the year after my first son was born when the yard
was overrun with pretty white flowers in the spring. My parents came
to visit, took one look out the back window, and (horrified) went out
with gloves and black plastic garbage bags to pull the offending
and noxious weed.

Since then, it's been a tradition on Earth Day to survey the
grounds, pull any garlic mustard I find, and look for trout lilies
and trillium. The weed-pulling ceremony is accompanied by ritual
consumption of part of the bitter harvest. Here's a recipe.

* one bunch garlic mustard, trimmed
* large pot boiling water
* salt

Boil the garlic mustard in a large pot of salted
water until the water turns a shade of green. Strain
out the greens. Bring another pot of water to a boil,
and repeat the boiling process until the water is no
longer discolored.

At this point I generally discard the garlic mustard
into the compost, after taking a ceremonial taste.
The greens contain a cyanide compound, alliarinoside, which
contributes both to the bitter taste and the gastric
distress that you might experience if you took the 
greens raw.

Some people tolerate garlic mustard better than others,
even to the point of making a pesto with it and basil.
For me, I can't stand it.
