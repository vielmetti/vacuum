### Free parking at Ann/Ashley structure, Saturdays during construction

The Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority is providing
free parking at the Ann/Ashley structure on Saturdays, as
part of the contribution to the Ann Arbor Farmers Market
to make up for disruption during the resurfacing of North
Fifth Avenue and Detroit Street. 

> The comprehensive nature of this project will make it necessary
for lane closures and temporary street closures throughout the
duration of the project. To mitigate parking demand in the neighborhood,
the DDA will offer free parking 7 a.m.-3 p.m. every Saturday
(beginning March 24) during construction at the Ann/Ashley Parking
Structure, two blocks away.
