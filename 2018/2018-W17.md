### University of Michigan - Congratulations graduates

Ann Arbor streets were filled this weekend with 2018 graduates
in caps and gowns. The Twitter hashtag #MGoGrad is full
of graduation photos, and selected tweets from graduates
have been featured on the big screen at Michigan Stadium
and other graduation venues, including this one from @ajh0lland 
noted by Peter Honeyman:
