### Ann Arbor water rates going up

Water rates in Ann Arbor are going up, with a complete
rate restructuring on the agenda for last Monday's working
session of Ann Arbor City Council.

The plan is twofold. First, water rates for
multifamily dwellings will be made separate
from single family houses, with a single fixed
rate for water use for apartment dwellers. Then
rates will be set on a graduated scale for single
family homes, with the greatest water users charged
the most.

The concern that I expressed at the working session
was that rates were anticipated to be very high for
the top tier of use, so high as to be difficult
for people to afford. The examples provided at council
did nothing to dispel this concern, focusing primarily
on typical use (18 CCF) rather than the top usage brackets.

### Radio: QSL card from AC8TO

One of the nice parts of the amateur radio hobby is
the tradition of sending postcards (QSL cards) to 
verify reception.

### Whitelines paper from Roaring Spring

If you like writing in paper notebooks, but need to
get a clean digital copy of what you have put on paper,
then the Whitelines paper may be just the thing for you.

### Searching for a black and white all-in-one laser printer

Our old printer is showing its age, and so it's time to hunt
for a new one. We're looking for an all-in-one printer with
a scanner on top and a black and white laser printer on the bottom.

### Recipe: Asparagus with pecans

It's spring somewhere, so asparagus is in season in the
stores. This simple preparation was a big hit as a side dish to
go with pizza.
