### Ann Arbor water rates going up

Water rates in Ann Arbor are going up, with a complete
rate restructuring on the agenda for last Monday's working
session of Ann Arbor City Council.

The plan is twofold. First, water rates for
multifamily dwellings will be made separate
from single family houses, with a single fixed
rate for water use for apartment dwellers. Then
rates will be set on a graduated scale for single
family homes, with the greatest water users charged
the most.

The concern that I expressed at the working session
was that rates were anticipated to be very high for
the top tier of use, so high as to be difficult
for people to afford. The examples provided at council
did nothing to dispel this concern, focusing primarily
on typical use (18 CCF) rather than the top usage brackets.

I took a look at about 3000 days of usage of my own
home to see how we compared. On a normal day, we're
well within the 18 CCF tier, and so normally we should
personally be fine no matter what happens. But if the
worst happens - a leaking toilet, a running hose - our
single-day usage is 5x or more what the normal is.
Add that up for only a few days per quarter and you
could be in the penalty zone.

What was least informative about all of the presentations
I've seen is how little detail there is about the distribution
of water usage over time. 18 CCF is described as "typical",
but there's no distribution of use, and especially no illustration
of the "long tail" of people in single-family houses who
happen to use a lot of water. If they don't find out right
quick that their bills are going up, there are some
nasty surprises waiting - surprises disproportionate
to the amount of water they happen to consume if they
are unlucky enough to be in a single-family home rather
than an apartment complex.

Michigan law includes the Bolt case, where sewer
rates were thrown out as an illegal tax. The Ann
Arbor proposal is carefully designed to avoid
Bolt.

What to expect if this set of rates go through? Those who
discover the changes in time will reduce their consumption,
depriving the city of expected revenue for new water plant
construction. Those who don't find out in time will
complain loudly, if they can. A few retired avid gardeners with
large lawns and fixed incomes will be in the worst
configuration; we don't know yet how many of these there
are predicted to be.

### Radio: QSL card from AC8TO

One of the nice parts of the amateur radio hobby is
the tradition of sending postcards (QSL cards) to 
verify reception. 

I received such a card from Don AC8TO last
week (thanks Don), acknowleging a conversation
we had on 2 meters. 

You can see an image of the card on the KB6NU
weblog. Dan Romanchik is a faithful ham radio blogger and
collects QSL cards that spell words, among many
other things.

### Whitelines paper from Roaring Spring

If you like writing in paper notebooks, but need to
get a clean digital copy of what you have put on paper,
then the Whitelines paper may be just the thing for you.

The paper, sold in the US by Roaring Spring, has
a pale grey background with white lines and a few
special marks on the page grid. These marks help a
cell phone application recognize the grid so that when
you take a snapshot of the page with the app it
reads it cleanly. The rendered photo erases the
white lines, leaving just the words you put down
on the page all neat and square.

Thanks to Roaring Spring for sending along a sample.

### Searching for a black and white all-in-one laser printer

Our old printer is showing its age, and so it's time to hunt
for a new one. We're looking for an all-in-one printer with
a scanner on top and a black and white laser printer on the bottom.

Generally people seem to be happy with recommendations
from The Wirecutter, but in this particular case the
first-place printer in their bakeoff didn't have a scanner,
and the second-place printer didn't get good compatibility
marks with Macs on Amazon.

I'm currently looking at one of the Brother models, something
along the lines of an Brother MFC-L2710DW or a Brother MFC-L2740DW.

The number of choices in all of these is baffling, with
new models coexisting with old models, and presumably
also with reviews of old software and firmware confusing
the issue somewhat.

### Recipe: Asparagus with pecans

It's spring somewhere, so asparagus is in season in the
stores. This simple preparation was a big hit as a side dish to
go with pizza.

* 1 bunch asparagus
* 1 pkg chopped pecans
* olive oil for saute
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 bunch green onions

Boil some water in a pan large enough to hold the asparagus
lengthwise.

If the pecans didn't come pre-chopped, chop them now.

Prepare the asparagus by snapping off the ends. Place the
asparagus in the boiling water and cook for about 3 minutes,
long enough for the asparagus to turn bright green and for
the color of the water to turn. Remove the asparagus from
the pan and transfer to a serving dish, and pour out the
water. 

Return the pan to medium-high heat with some olive oil.

Chop the garlic small, and chop the green onions. Add the
garlic and onions to the pan and cook until fragrant and
just browned. Add the chopped pecans and continue to cook
until the nuts are fragrant and just browned.

Spoon the nut mixture into the serving dish with the asparagus.

There are a bunch of "asparagus with pecans" recipes below,
and the full set of them admits many possibilities. You
might season with lemon or a balsamic vinegar, or use browned
butter instead of olive oil. If you prefer, the asparagus
can be roasted instead of blanched.

### Lunch Thursday March 22 at El Harissa

The a2b3 lunch group will be at El Harissa (Maple Road at Miller Road)
on Thursday, March 22. This place is a regular favorite, serving
a wide variety of north African and Mediterranen inspired food.

Last week's tally was 5 people at The Lunch Room.
