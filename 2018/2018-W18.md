### Ann Arbor City Council votes to repurchase Y Lot; litigation to follow

At a special meeting of Ann Arbor City Council on Tuesday, Council voted
unanimously to exercise its option to repurchase the old Y lot (350 S Fifth Ave,
next to Blake Transit Center). Council's decision does not mean there will
be instant action and construction on the site, as the parcel is currently
the subject of litigation between the City and owner Dennis Dahlmann.

### Ann Arbor City Council: agenda for May 7 2018

Ann Arbor City Council has a busy agenda for the evening of Monday,
May 7, 2018.  A 19-item consent agenda has over $10 million of
spending, with big ticket items including nearly $5 million for
street resurfacing (CA-15), $2.6 million for water and sewer work
(CA-17), $1.2 million for human services funding (CA-8) and $867,616
for a multi-year software contract for Microsoft software (CA-19).
There's also $34,780 for Tasers for the police department (CA-11),
and $89,285 for sewage-lift station radio upgrades (CA-16).

Six public hearings are on the agenda, which could make for a long
meeting. ORD-18-06 (PH-1) would change special exemption uses for fraternity
and sorority houses. PH-4 deals with fees for commercial quadricycles.
PH-5 deals with public works fees, including fees for renting traffic
cones (to $97/event plus $0.67/cone).

Lots of street closings are planned for this summer, including

* Live on Washington, June 2
* Taste of Ann Arbor, June 3
* Top of the Park, June 4 - July 4
* Tech Trek, June 15
* The Event on Main, June 21 - June 22

It's budget season, and PH-6 is a public hearing on the budget.

Take good notes! I'm going to miss this meeting because of travel.

### Ann Arbor Farmers Market starts Wednesday operations

You know it's summer when the Farmers Market starts Wednesday operations.
Market opens at 7:00 a.m. and goes to 3:00 p.m. Wednesdays and Saturdays.
There's free parking at the Ann / Ashley structure on Saturdays during
market hours, and a Boober Tours shuttle offering to take you back and 
forth to the structure (really, it's not that far).

### Cobblestone Farm Market starts Tuesday May 22 2018

Cobblestone Farm Market starts operations on Tuesday, May 22 for the
season. The market is on Packard Road by Buhr Park and runs from 4:00 p.m.
to 7:00 p.m Tuesdays from May 22 to October 23.

### Washtenaw County First Saturday siren test a success

On the first Saturday of the month during the spring, summer,
and fall, the Washtenaw County Emergency Operations Center
tests its outdoor warning sirens. Amateur radio operators are
encouraged to check in in advance of the event, and during
siren activation there is a net that runs on the county 
SKYWARN repeater, N8DUY (145.15-). 

I activated for this test (sirens! so fun) and verified that
the siren near Lohr and Textile Road was behaving properly.
All in all the operation of 14 of the county's 87 sirens was
checked, and all 14 of those reported on were operating 
correctly. 

The next county test is Saturday, June 2, 2018 at noon.
City of Ann Arbor sirens are tested on the second Tuesday
of the month at 1:00 p.m.; the next city test is on May 8.

### Kerrytown low light pollution fixtures

Thanks to the University Lowbrow Astronomers, the light fixtures that
are being newly installed in Kerrytown will emit less light pollution.
From Sally Oey and the "Dark Sky Group" at the University of Michigan
Astronomy Department:

> Excited that our dark sky group has our first major victory!
Chris Elenbaas, a City engineer, confirms that the Kerrytown street
light upgrades will adopt the version of the globes with the top
halves blocked out.  As you may recall, the specific globe models
were already approved, so the only options for modification were
to look at different submodels from the manufacturer.  We lucked
out that one submodel is this more dark-sky-friendly version.
Moreover, the design was also tweaked to allow lower wattage to
reduce glare.  Thanks to everyone's quick feedback during the test
phase, our preferred option has been chosen!  As you can see from
the construction in Kerrytown, the project is already underway.

(Now, to make Michigan Stadium's evening glow more dark sky friendly.)

### Newsletter: Teacher Patti on beer and history

Teacher Patti (Patti Smith) has a new newsletter out, covering
both local beer and local history. From her edition of April 29:

> Michigan Argus, April 29, 1864 – E. Ketchum of Ypsilanti would
send you a small treatise on Ice Cream & the Philosophy of its
Manufacture if you just send him your address.

### Student move-out a trash-picking success

When the students move out it's "hippie Christmas", with
choice pickings left on the curb for the astute to recycle
and reuse. This year our family scored a laptop computer,
a large screen monitor, and three very nice warm winter
scarves.

### Bløm Meadworks is open

Such is the report from the field, haven't been in yet. Peter Honeyman
writes:

> bløm mead bar, which opened up across the street today, is jumping

Ben Connor-Barrie gives the pre-opening scoop on Damn Arbor:

> Bløm Meadworks, Ann Arbor's first meadery is opening this Saturday
at Noon. It's located at 100 S 4th Ave on the first floor of the
Courthouse Square apartment building. I went to undergrad with
Lauren Bloom, who co-owns the meadery with her husband Matt Ritchey.
They were kind enough to grant me an interview and give me a tour
last Friday.

### Recipe: Ginger Cabbage

Adapted from Martha Rose Shulman's "Fast Vegetarian Feasts".

Ingredients: one large head Chinese cabbage; ginger; garlic; coconut
oil; soy sauce; sesame oil; rice vinegar; cornstarch; sesame seeds.

Wash the head of Chinese cabbage (aka "napa cabbage") and slice it
into pieces about 1/8 of an inch wide. Heat the coconut oil in a large
pot. Grate a generous amount of ginger and squeeze several cloves of
garlic into the hot oil, and cook until fragrant. Add the sliced cabbage
to the pot and cook until the cabbage is all hot and wilted.

Make a sauce with the soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice vinegar; the
choice of proportions is yours, but you'll end up with maybe a third of
a cup of sauce. Add a little cornstarch and mix well, then add the
sauce to the cabbage and stir to coat. Cook long enough that the
sauce thickens a little. Mix in a generous amount of sesame seeds. 
Serve hot.
