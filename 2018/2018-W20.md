### Ann Arbor City Council agenda

The agenda for Monday night's Ann Arbor City Council meeting has
been posted.

On the agenda of interest: a proposal to raise water, sewer, and
stormwater rates (B-2); an exemption to the noise ordinance for
snow removal equipment (B-4); and a collective bargaining agreement
for police officers (CA-10).

A proposal to amend the Medical Marijuana Permit Ordinance is
at second reading; it would cap at 26 the number of dispensaries
allowed in the city (B-5).

Five public hearings include an annexation, water rates, an extension
of sidewalk maintenance rules, the noise ordinance, and changes to
the marijuana dispensary laws, and the marijuana provisioning center
limit proposal.

Street closings include Movies on Maynard (June 1-2), Sonic Lunch
(June 14, August 2, and August 30), Townie Street Party (July 15-18),
African-American Downtown Festival (June 1-2), and the Dart for Art
road race (July 16). Other approvals include the Jaycees Summer Carnival
(June 18-24).

I'm guessing that the meeting won't run overly long, though 
marijuana law-making always draws a crowd.

### Ann Arbor Farmers Market report: rhubarb and asparagus season

It's local rhubarb and asparagus season at Ann Arbor Farmers Market
and Argus Farm Stop. Expect to spend $4-6 per bunch for each.

Rhubarb grows well even in the presence of hungry deer, making
it an ideal low maintenance crop.

Slow Farm is a u-pick farm just north of Ann Arbor with u-pick asparagus,
and now is the season. 4700 Whitmore Lake Rd, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105
between Joy and Warren Road.

### La Taqueria opens in downtown Ann Arbor

La Taqueria has opened across from Liberty Street Robot in
downtown Ann Arbor. The menu is $4 tacos in a variety of
savory flavors. I haven't been in yet.

### Tracking airplanes with dump1090 and FlightAware

The Raspberry Pi in my attic is connected to a software-defined radio
tuner stick, running software called `dump1090` which listens for
transmissions from aircraft. The transmissions on 1090 Mhz are
basically line of sight. On a clear day with a good antenna and a
clear view of the sky the maximum range to listen is about 250 miles;
from my perch in the attic and a modest antenna, I can see about 50
miles worth of airplane traffic.

I've started feeding this data to FlightAware, which consolidates
reports from around the world (and also from satellites) and provides
real-time tracking of flights.

The next bit of technology to try is a specialized tuner stick, one
that has a passband filter to only tune in this particular set of signals,
and a low-noise amplifier tuned to just this band.

### Wireguard, a VPN tool

Wireguard is a set of tools for Linux, Mac, and Android that let
you build fast and efficient VPN tunnels. It is implemented as
a Linux kernel driver, and is compact enough to be practical to
use even on small systems like the Raspberry Pi.

At the moment, installing the system is a little bit tricky -
you may have to compile a kernel module - and the software is
very clearly marked as testing with possible and known bugs and
no assurance that the security promises there are when it's
released will have been actually realized just yet.

> Warning: WireGuard is currently under development, and therefore any installation steps here should be considered as experimental. We are rapidly working toward mainline inclusion, at which point we will consider this codebase non-experimental.

To install on the Mac, use Homebrew and `brew install wireguard-tools`.
There are also instructions for Ubuntu, Android, Debian, Fedora,
CentOS, RHEL, Arch Linux, OpenSUSE, Alpine, Gentoo, NixOS, and more.
