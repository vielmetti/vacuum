### Ann Arbor City Council: the Y lot

For the Monday April 2 edition of the Ann Arbor City Council, council
will deliberate a $4.5 million budget item which would bring back
into city ownership the undeveloped "Old YMCA" lot across from the
downtown Ann Arbor District Library and next to the Blake Transit Center.

> On April 2, 2014, the City executed a deed ("Deed") to Fifth Fourth, LLC ("Fifth Fourth") for the property commonly known as 350 South Fifth Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 ("Property"). The Deed provides that Fifth Fourth's interest in the Property is conditioned on, among other things, its acquisition of a certificate of occupancy for Deed-prescribed improvements prior to January 1, 2018 (administratively extended to by April 2, 2018, at Fifth Fourth's request). If Fifth Fourth fails to satisfy this (and all other) conditions, the Deed provides that title to the Property returns to the City with its payment of the lesser of $4.2 million or the appraised value of the Property.

Fifth Fourth LLC is controlled by Dennis Dahlmann. Dahlmann
sued the city in February 2018 over the terms of this property
transaction, alleging in part that "All of the forms of purported agreement between the parties presume the
existence of a usable interconnection between the Library Lane Parking Structure and the
Y Lot", and also that if the City were to buy back the parcel
at the previously agreed upon terms that the City would be
"unjustly enriched".

Eight votes are required by council on this decision, which
might be a challenge for a council that's been divided 7-4 on 
many issues.

### Ann Arbor: failed development projects

TreeDowntown has a nice photo-essay on failed development projects in
Ann Arbor, featuring concept drawings of a dozen efforts that were
designed but not built. The downtown landscape would be very different
if even a few of these efforts had come into being.

### Ann Arbor / Pittsfield Township: newly remodeled Zingerman's Bakehouse

The newly remodeled Zingerman's Bakery space is in Zingertown, an
otherwise unremarkable set of industrial park buildings near the 
Ann Arbor Airport in Pittsfield township.

I'm often there and at the adjacent coffee company on Sunday mornings
finishing up this newsletter.

### University of Michigan to rename CC Little building

The University of Michigan will rename the CC Little Building,
named after a former University president who advocated for
eugenics and worked for the tobacco industry. This comes after
several years of student advocacy bringing the issue to light.

The building will be known temporarily as the "1100 North University Building",
until a suitably generous donor can be found to fund a new name.

### Macomb County Clerk removed from office

The Macomb County Clerk, Karen Spranger, was removed from office by
a St Clair County judge who found that she did not live in the
county when she was elected in 2016. Spranger won a close race as
a Republican, riding on the coat-tails of a presidential campaign.

### In other newsletters: Finn Brunton's "Passing Current"

> An occasional research notebook: history! money! utopian promise!
glaciers! computers! cities! deep time! cybernetics! knots! music!
hideous strangeness! precision and soul!

Even when Finn is writing the honest truth about historical matters
with a precision and eye for detail and texture, his observations
are so fantastic that they read like Borgesian fiction.

### Multimeters, digital and analog

The attic has a lot of old electronics in it, some of which is
perpetually in need of repair or new batteries.  There's also a lot
of used batteries up there, some of which are dead.  A good way to
test a battery is with a multimeter, which will read out voltage
and which usually has a good/bad signal.

The analog multimeter I have is an old GE unit that goes new for
about $10. It's fine for battery checking but is otherwise unremarkable.
A query to Twitter produced two recommendations for digital
multimeters. Thom W8TAM suggested the Fluke 115 (about $160) as a
good low-end unit from the well-regarding Fluke line of test
electronics. For a smaller budget, Dan KB6NU suggested the Extech
330 (about $60) which he also recommended to the Ann Arbor District
Library's "Secret Lab" maker space.

### Radio: Soundesign 4-band TV1/TV2/AM/FM; "Franken-FM"

The radio of the week is an early 1980s Soundesign 4-band (AM/FM/TV1/TV2)
set with a not-very-fresh 9V battery, parts scavenged from the attic
and tested with the above mentioned multimeter.  I tested the set
by listening to Jessica Webster's Sunday afternoon jazz show, "The
In Crowd" on WEMU-FM 89.1.

Analog TV's old NTSC standard encoded the audio of TV programs in
the same FM format used by broadcast radio. There are still a few
stations broadcasting on the audio piece of analog channel 6,
including stations in New York City, Cleveland, and Chicago. If you
tune to 87.7 in one of those cities you'll pick up what sounds like an
ordinary FM station - except that really it isn't.

Ernie Smith did a long piece for his Tedium newsletter about channel
6 "Franken-FM" stations, reprinted in Atlas Obscura. By exploiting
little-known parts of the intersection between radio and TV regulation,
these hybrid TV/radio stations carve out an extra channel in the busy
broadcast spectrum.

### Ann Arbor: Fool Moon and Festifools, April 6 and 8 2018

Friday night April 6 2018 is Fool Moon, a luminary parade
to a downtown street party in Ann Arbor. This is followed
on April 8 2018 by Festifools, which features giant 
paper-mache puppets on Main Street.

### Ann Arbor: School millage election, May 8 2018

From the Civ City newsletter:

> On Tuesday, May 8, residents in the Ann Arbor Public Schools
district will vote on a tax proposal to replace the district's
"non-homestead" operating tax â€“ that is, a tax on commercial,
industrial and rental property, vacant land and second homes. It
is NOT a tax on primary residences. This operating millage is the
main source of revenue for the district.

### Ann Arbor: AACME Creativity and Making Expo, May 20 2018

> The Ann Arbor Mini Maker Faire has been rebranded as the Ann Arbor
Creativity & Making Expo (AACME)! And will be on Sunday, May 20
from 12-5pm at the Ann Arbor downtown library. It's the 10-year
anniversary of this event! Let's celebrate!

### Recipe: kale

This simple recipe is a great way to use winter kale.

* 1 bunch kale
* coconut oil
* green onions
* soy sauce
* rice vinegar
* toasted sesame oil
* sesame seeds

Boil a large pot of water.

Wash the kale well and chop into fine ribbons, discarding
the toughest stems. Place it into the boiling water, and
blanch for three minutes. Drain the water and set the blanched
kale aside in a serving dish.

Return the pot to the heat. Heat the coconut oil until
hot. Wash, trim, and chop the green onions. Saute the green
onions in the oil until fragrant and light brown. 

Return the kale to the hot pan. Saute until the retained
liquid is gone. Add some soy sauce, rice vinegar, and a
little toasted sesame oil; stir well. 

Return the kale mixture to the serving dish; garnish with
sesame seeds.
