### University of Michigan: Respect the lecs, no LEO walkout

Lecturers at the University of Michigan decided not to conduct
a walkout after their negotiations with the University led to
credible promises of improvements in wages. A contract has not
yet been signed.

### Ann Arbor District Library checkout summary software (Ross Kinder)

Every Saturday, a little printer attached to a Raspberry Pi prints out
a list of books that Ross Kinder and his family have checked out, 
so that they can round up books that are due and take them back to the
library. Ross shares his code (written in Go) that navigates the library
web site and produces a compact report suitable for printing on a receipt
printer.

### Ann Arbor Water Department usage summary software (Peter Honeyman)

Peter Honeyman wrote a little piece of software (in sed and awk and gnuplot)
that downloads and plots your water usage over time. The City of Ann Arbor
is plotting to increase water rates, so this might be a good time for you
to graph past usage and identify any issues like leaky toilets that contribute
to high use.

### Water Hill Music Fest: May 6, 2018

The Water Hill Music Fest is in the Water Hill neighborhood northwest
of downtown on May 6, 2018. A list of expected performances is up.
If you live in the neighborhood and are not performing, you can still
participate by offering up your bathroom as a "Water Hill Water Closet".

> "Water Hill Water Closet" hosts arrange their own list of volunteers
to take shifts welcoming grateful visitors who need to use the
facilities.

### Recipe: Tofu stuffed shells

There are a bunch of recipes for tofu stuffed shells on the net.
Our version involves cooking jumbo shells, then stuffing them
with a mixture of cooked spinach, onion, and mashed tofu. Top
with a red sauce and some grated cheese and bake. This is a good
recipe for a crowd as the process lends itself to having lots of
help in the kitchen for the assembly step.
