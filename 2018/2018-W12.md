### Ann Arbor: not quite what it seems - deer cull

ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A report says the contractor overseeing Ann
Arbor’s deer management program significantly overestimated the
animal’s population last year in the city.

### Ann Arbor: not quite what it seems - recycling rates 

Members of the Ann Arbor Environmental Commission were
presented with updated numbers at the week's meeting,
informing them that the city's recycling rate had been
overestimated.

In the "Staff Presentation on Metrics", Josh MacDonald
said that the lead sentence on the city web site,
"Over 50% of Ann Arbor waste is diverted from landfills for recycling or composting,"
was too high due to miscounting of trash and recycling
coming from commercial waste haulers who have routes that
serve adjacent townships in addition to the city.

are not on the City web site yet; my FOIA ID is 1318.

### Ann Arbor: not quite what it seems - public comment

A long-time resident of Ann Arbor, Shirley Beckley, was
nominated by the Human Rights Commission to a task force
that would help set the agenda for citizen police oversight
in the city. The mayor, Christopher Taylor, rejected this 
nomination based in part on comments Beckley had made
previously at public comment time at a council meeting on November 5, 2015,
one year after the shooting death of Aura Rosser.

The official minutes of that meeting read

> Shirley Beckley spoke about the anniversary of the Aura
Rosser Police-initiated shooting death, and urged Council to seek justice and admit
their mistake.

but the Mayor focused on the last sentence of Beckley's comment,
as reported by the Ann Arbor News:

> "You had alternatives to deal with her, rather than kill her," she said, suggesting Ried should be fired.
> "If you won't at least fire officer Ried, then ... let's string him up," she said, drawing applause from other demonstrators.

Taylor characterized Beckley's comments as though
they were a call for violence against Reid, a
conclusion that I can't agree with after reviewing
the recording (linked below). 

Beckley was interviewed by the Living Oral History Project
in May 2015.

### Ann Arbor: Vogel's locksmith closing

The oldest business in downtown Ann Arbor is closing.
Vogel's Locksmith, which was established in 1913, closes
at the end of March 2018 after a 105 year run. Owners Robert
and Denise Vogel are retiring.

### Why is the bathtub draining so slowly?

Our bathtub had a very slow drain which eventually stopped
entirely. Some fishing around in the pipes with a drain snake
discovered the reason: a LEGO piece had gotten lodged in the drain.

Please, kids, don't take your LEGO into the bathtub.

### "One must imagine Sisyphus happy"

From "The Myth of Sisyphus", by Albert Camus.

> I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds
one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that
negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is
well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither
sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of
that night filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle
itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must
imagine Sisyphus happy.

The modern Sisyphus is condemned to empty his inbox daily,
knowing well that it will fill up the next day. (And here I
am, filling your inbox with some of the contents of mine).

"The workman of today works everyday in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is no less absurd."

### Recipe: Cookie Sheet Chicken

There are an infinite number of varieties of this recipe, but
the basic idea is pretty simple to describe. Arrange inexpensive
cuts of chicken on a cookie sheet, and fill the remaining space
with chunks of vegetables - potatoes, brussels sprouts, carrots,
onions, broccoli, and the like - that will roast alongside the chicken
and cook in the chicken fat. Roast until the chicken is done.
