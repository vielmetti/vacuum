### Strawberry and pea picking at Rowe's Produce Farm

Rowe's Produce Farm in Rawsonville (Martz Rd south of I-94
off Rawsonville Road) has U-Pick strawberries and peas. With
the boys we picked two flats of strawberries and a big tub of
peas. Both seasons are short so if you want to get out the
time is now.
