### Solstice

June 21, 2018 was the summer solstice, with a day that
was 15 hours, 16 minutes, and 34 seconds long. From here
on out the days get shorter until December. 

### Ham Radio Field Day

Ham Radio Field Day was Saturday and Sunday, June 23-24 2018.
The ARROW and University of Michigan amateur radio clubs set
up 5 stations at the Ann Arbor Airport and made more than 2200
contacts in a 24 hour period. One of those contacts was mine
on 40 meters phone.

I had a good time there showing off my portable ADS-B airplane spotting
rig, made up of a FlightAware USB tuner and a Nooelec antenna. Without
anything more than plugging it in and putting the laptop outside
I was seeing airplanes 90 miles away.

Thanks to everyone for participating! Special thanks to 
Thom W8TAM and Julie K8VOX for bringing delicious barbeque,
and to Mayor Chris Taylor for visiting to help give the
club the "elected official visit" bonus points.

### Trip report: Chicago

Earlier this week I was in Chicago for the Github Constellation
event. This was two half-day conferences back to back, the
first aimed at enterprise customers, the second aimed at open
source projects. 

The enterprise track was very interesting with two women who
head up projects at different insurance companies talking separately on
the same theme of the ways that source code control can be used 
to improve how well systems can be audited. Their goal was to be
able to tell the auditor for every line of code in the system
which requirements document motivated the code or the change.

On the open source front, I was impressed by the talk on Probot, 
which is a bot you can configure to keep you Github issues under
control. I've deployed this bot with a "stale" configuration to
remind me to close or update issus that are 60 days old without
activity.

I stayed at what was perhaps my favorite budget lodging in Chicago.
Hostels International runs a hostel on Randolph St in the Loop.
I had a super-deluxe private bedroom, but you can share a room
with other travelers and spend less than $50 for a night. Compared
to sky-high Chicago hotel rates it's a tremendous bargain, and
the staff is friendly and helpful.

### Storm report: Houghton

Houghton, Michigan and the Keweenaw Peninsula had a tremendous
downpour last weekend, and they are still cleaning up. A disaster
has been declared. Satellite images show lots of silt and debris
and dirt turning the Portage Canal brown.

### Market report

This week's highlights were fresh dill and cucumbers. The
very last day of strawberry picking is upon us. 

### Raspberry Pi Jam at AADL Secret Lab

The AADL Secret Lab had a "Raspberry Pi Jam" for kids and
adults looking to spend some time programming this popular
small computer. I was there doing some experimenting with
using a console cable and a very short Ethernet cable to get
remote access to one of the dozen or so Pi's that the AADL
has in stock.

### Laundry at Mr. Stadium

Our washing machine doesn't spin on the spin cycle, so it
was time to go to Mr. Stadium and run a weekly load of wash.
Next week's task is to get the washer fixed before it's time
to go back. Mr. Stadium has fantastic triple-load Milnor washers
and enormous Huebsch dryers quite suitable for washing pillows
and comforters and other bedding that doesn't fit in the home
machine.

### TeacherPatti playing protest music on WCBN-FM

Patti "TeacherPatti" Smith was spinning protest tunes on 
her show on WCBN-FM 88.3 Ann Arbor. I was in Chicago
at the time but I tuned in via the Internet and even
sent a few requests to the DJ.

### Ann Arbor City Council Admin Committee report

The Ann Arbor City Council Admin Committee meets before
City Council meetings to be briefed on the agenda by 
City Administrator Howard Lazarus. The meeting is poorly
attended by the public, poorly noticed (though strictly 
speaking fulfills the minimum requirements of the law for notice),
and never publishes an agenda in advance. Still, I went
there, and got a photo of the agenda to look at.

### Probot and "stale" for Github issues

As mentioned above, Github's "Probot" is a tool that helps
you manage Github Issues. It's similar to Alex Ellis's "derek"
and Miek Gieben's "dreck" bots. Very helpful if you need to
keep a conversation under control, or if you're running a 
private repo and need periodic reminders that you are forgetting
to finish up tasks that you started months ago.
